- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E8EAF6), offering a subtle, clean backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#9575CD), providing a gentle contrast and visual interest to highlight key actions.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for both headings and body text to maintain a modern, clean, and readable design.
- Use flat, line-style icons to represent project statuses and actions, ensuring clarity and a modern aesthetic.
- Employ a card-based layout to present projects and editor information, enhancing visual organization and ease of use.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to provide a smooth, responsive user experience.
